# Buffer-Overflow
This was my os semester project.
Exploiting stack buffer overflow vulnerability on FreeFloat FTP server that results in a reverse shell to the victim machine. To start off you need a kali linux machine from where you will be sending the exploit code and your windows vm machine which will be the target. 
You will need to download some resources in your windows machine: 
1. Immunity debugger
2. FreeFloat FTP server
The attached pdf gives a detailed explanation on how to exploit this vulnerability.
